### 🃏 Jumping Card Gallery

Why settle for flat, boring galleries when you can have a bouncy stack of cards that literally jump into place? ✨
This component creates a playful card gallery where each card appears with a smooth elastic bounce, stacked half-over each other for that stylish layered look.

When you hover on a card, it slides out with a rotation, giving the whole gallery an interactive, dynamic feel 🎉
